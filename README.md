# React Repo
// in package.json we added "start" and "build" in scripts - basically those are used for working on project
        "start" : "parcel index.html" -- it is used for the project to run in development mode
        "build" : "parcel build index.html" -- it is used for the project too build the project
                here index.html is entry mode of project
    "npx parcel index.html" is simillar to "npm run start" or "npm start"
    "npx parcel index.html" is simillar to "npm run build" but not "npm build" as "start" is a key word reserved by npm

// Destrcturing the props...??
// use of optional chaining("?") in destrcturing..?
